No Internet

Sitting here in my office without a connection to the internet. As my job actually requires that I have a good connection for things like phones, the ticket system, email and remote support tools. Without internet, I can't work. Instead, let's take a minute and say hi.

###Hi

Used to be, there was a time when I would share with you technology tips, recipes, Wordpress nerdy goodness and photos. I haven't done that for a while and that is 100% on me. No excuses, no bullshit, I just didn't post. Time to change that.

I have been posting with some regularity on the hidden blog, just to get back to actually writing. No you can't read it, but thanks for asking.
